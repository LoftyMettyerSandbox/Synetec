# Synetec Basic Angular MVC assessement

This is my attempted answer for Synetec's basic Angular developer assessment.

# Notes
I have implemented a ngx-datatable component which will mean you'll need to rerun the npm install to get it. It's functioning correctly, but whilst doing some testing I have noticed there are some F12 errors when you attempt to sort the grid, according to Google this is a version issue with other components so I either need to resolve that or downgrade the component. I'm hoping that this is not a concern at this stage for this exam. If its a problem shout and I'll get it sorted.

I get quite a few red error messages when doing an npm install (the package-lock.json) - doesn't seem to affect functionality though, and these errors are reflected as a warning on the repository, it looks like there are a number of out of date dependencies that are causing security alerrt (axios, cryptiles to name two). Again I don't think this is part of this projecty to resolve.

This was done on a new machine which seems to have got installed with formatting to 2 tab spaces and took me ages to track  down (I had VS Code and Visual Studio open at the same time and they were fighting each other!). Most files set back correctly, but there may be the odd whitespacing issue still lying around.
